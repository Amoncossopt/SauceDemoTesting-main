# Mini Automated Testing Project

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to create a testing framework to support the automation testing of https://www.saucedemo.com/. This framework was to be created adhering to the POM design approach for automation testing, with the following tools used:

 - Selenium to enable simulations interactions with browser elements
 - SpecFlow to enable feature files to be written that mapped to user stories on our project board
 - Gherkin as a means of writing concise and readable acceptance criteria for user stories to represent user journeys on the website, which could then be mapped to test cases
